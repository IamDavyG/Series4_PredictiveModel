# Can we Predict Active Compounds in OSM Series 4?

The [Series 4 triazolopyrazines](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series4/wiki) are a promising series of compounds that originate from a HTS at Pfizer. Compounds in the series have been shown to possess high potency (down to 16 nM). Additionally, two compounds have show efficacy _in vivo_. [Inherited information](http://malaria.ourexperiment.org/biological_data/7934/) for Series 4 and [follow-up studies](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series4/wiki/Mechanism-of-Action%3A-Possible-PfATP4-Activity-Deduced-from-Parasite-Ion-Regulation-Assays), implicate the mechanism of action for Series 4 is _via_ inhibition of the malaria parasites ability to regulate its intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration using a P-type Na<sup>+</sup>-ATPase transporter ([<I>Pf</I>ATP4](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series4_PredictiveModel/wiki/PfATP4-and-Series-4)). There is correlation between _in vitro_ potency and <I>Pf</I>ATP4 activity.

We need to develop ways to predict new and potent Series 4 compounds in the absence of structural information of <I>Pf</I>ATP4. [Initial attempts](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series4_PredictiveModel/wiki/Creating-a-Predictive-Model) were made by Murray Robertson in 2015, and a follow-up competition was [launched in 2016](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series4_PredictiveModel/wiki/Round-1). This competition was designed to involve and utilise the expertise of the scientific community. There were 6 submissions by the end of the competition, and two equally well-performing models (created by Ho-Leung Ng and James McCulloch) were awarded prizes.

A subsequent round is [currently on-going](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series4_PredictiveModel/wiki/Round-2) with the aim of involving companies and individuals specialising in AI and machine learning.

**If you would like to participate, there is still time. All the relevant information can be found in either the [Wiki](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series4_PredictiveModel/wiki) or [this issue](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series4_PredictiveModel/issues/1). If you have any questions, please post on the issue.**

# What is currently needed for the paper?

The paper is being written up in the GoogleDoc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aD29GjC8RjqrSDcWcEUptS04Z2v10deReRp0eB3kcp4/edit?usp=sharing). Please edit accordingly.

- The basis for the introduction has been written up but still needs expanding in some areas.
- A very brief description of Round 1 is there but more information is required about the details of each of the original submitted models.
- A graphical summary of the judging and results of the Round 1 submissions needs to be created.
- The easiest thing is to be writing up anything that's happening in Round 2 as we go. If you have been participating in this round, it would be great if you could add anything relevant to the paper that describe your models/methods.
